  <p><img src="{{ site.owner.avatar }}" height="75" width="75" class="avatar" /> Hi! Iâ€™m Stephen Wong, a software developer based in Hangzhou, where I am currently working as a Ruby Programmer at <a href="http://www.sonkwo.com" target="_blank">Sonkwo</a>.</p>
  <p>I am passionate about technology in general and especially in programming languages and open source technologies, and I've been developed applications using Ruby, Java, Javascript, Html+Css, Bootstrap.</p>
  <p>I like to learn new things about programming languages and open source technologies. This blog was built in order to  write about those things.</p>
