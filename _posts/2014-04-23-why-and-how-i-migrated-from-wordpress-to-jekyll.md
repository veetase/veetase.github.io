Since I started writing this blog I've always used <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> and it's great, but the need to update Wordpress and its plug ins (a lot of them) always annoyed me.

Even I don't have much more time to write here I always wanted to write again. After I decided to write back, I also decided to improve my blog, with a new theme and a better and fun way to write posts.

####My choice and why
I chose to migrate this blog from Wordpress to <a href="http://jekyllrb.org/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. But why Jekyll?

Unlike Wordpress, Jekyll isn't a full CMS, it's a lot simpler, I can have a static site that is a lot lighter than Wordpress and mainly I just wanted to learn a new tool.

More reasons why I choose Jekyll were:

* It's in Ruby :)
* It uses <a href="http://liquidmarkup.org" taget="_blank">liquid</a> for the templating
* I can use git for the versioning of both code and posts
* Posts can be written in Markdown

####Select a theme
 I found the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme" target="_blank">hpstr-jekyll-theme</a> for Jekyll. so I decided to use it as a base for my own new theme.
 Here is the post tell how to use it : <a href="http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/">http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/</a>




####Hosting on Github Pages
Well, hosting static content in <a href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> is a piece of cake and it's completely free.
I just had to create a new repository there and send (git push) my files to it. It's super easy! :)

I've used the pages below to understand how to use Jekyll with Github Pages and how to set up my own domain.
