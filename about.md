Hi! Iâ€™m Stephen Wong, a programmer based in Shenzhen, where I am currently working as a Web developer at Big Pavilion.

I am passionate about technology in general and especially in programming languages and open source technologies, and I've been developed applications using Ruby, Java, Javascript, PHP, Swift.

I like to learn new things about programming languages and open source technologies. This blog was built in order to write about those things.
